# Welcome to my corner of the internet

Hello! This is my first post in this new setup. 

I'm Jhimy Michel, and this is where I'll be sharing thoughts, experiences, and things I'm learning along the way. You might find posts about:

- **Technology** - coding discoveries, tools I'm exploring
- **Travel** - places I visit, experiences from living between Switzerland and Spain  
- **Photography** - moments I capture (you can see more in the photography section)
- **Random thoughts** - whatever feels worth sharing

Nothing too formal, just authentic thoughts from someone navigating tech, travel, and life.

Thanks for stopping by!
